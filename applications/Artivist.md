## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful Mintbase grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- Artivist dApp will connect artists, activists, and NGOs in fundraising campaigns through the sale of NFTs offered on Mintbase.
- A brief description of your project.
- The dApp will allow NGOs to connect to artists based on the causes they support. They will be able to "match", similar to Tinder. When the NGO finds an artist, they get in touch to start a fundraising campaign. The artist will provide an NFT minted on Mintbase. Part of the sale will go to the NGO, part will go to the artist, and part will go to Artivist.   
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem.
- We will use Mintbase as our marketplace. 
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
- The idea behind Artivist comes from Chamada Artivista, an initiative started in 2020 by Carol Bampa. Chamada Artivista was a way to provide alternative funding options to mission-driven organizations. Carol invited artists to create artworks; the chosen pieces were sold online. The initiative was more successful than she initially believed. With Covid, however, the project came to a halt. Carol learned about the possibilities of NFTs and saw their potential to amplify fundraising campaigns. She envisioned an app that could facilitate the connection between NGOs and artists – a mix of Tinder and Kickstarter. She met Mariana Westphalen, who came from the Arts Sector and became Artivist co-founder, on NEAR Discord channel. They have been building Artivist since March 2022. In September they met Global DV Consulting, a team of developers that has been working on NEAR projects since XXXX.


### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- [Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/08AC3RjZSFVie47ddZ8afN/Artivist?node-id=411%3A887)
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- ASK DEVS
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- ASK DEVS
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- ASK DEVS
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- [Research with artists](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1au6lpNh7lob14ehDxszaHViX3m651JSc/view) 
- LINKAR WEBPAGE
- [NEAR forum](https://gov.near.org/tag/artivist-dao)
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Mintbase landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Although there are places where artists and collectors connect to trade art (Mintbase, Paras, etc) in the Near ecosystem, the presence of NGOs is still marginal. 
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- The main target audience for Artivist dApp will be the NGOs. The dApp will also function as a portfolio of artists in favor of social causes, and a place where consciencious NFT collectors will find interesting artworks and be able to contribute with NGOs. Moreover, companies concerned with ESG goals can become involved and support Artivist campaigns. 
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- - According to NGOFacts data, there are about 10 million NGOs in the world. And people increasingly believe in these projects: the number of individuals who donated money to these institutions increased from 1.2 billion in 2011 to 1.4 billion in 2014, and 80% of citizens agree that NGOs contribute to positive social change around the world. NGOs often don't have access to fair funding because of government restrictions and bureaucracy. Artivist dApp will be a tool for NGOs to obtain resources and carry out their governance in the Near ecosystem. Fostering this transition to web3 through the Near protocol implies a potential turnover of Near tokens in favor of social-environmental causes, strengthening the purpose of the Protocol to be a sustainable ecosystem, with neutral environmental impacts and positive social impacts. Artivist will spread the word about the Near ecosystem through campaigns, therefore attracting a conscious public that can discover all the possibilities of the Near blockchain through the community. Connecting with Mintbase will be an opportunity for growth for Artivist and Mintbase. 
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Mintbase / NEAR ecosystem?
- Yes, BeeTogether is platform that promotes fundraising campaigns. 
- If so, how is your project different?
- It will be different because the dApp will automate the process of connecting NGOs to artists (https://bee-together.org/about/). 
- If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
- DoinGud functions in a similar way to BeeTogether, and also doesn't connect automatically NGOs to artists (https://doingud.com/).

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Mintbase. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
